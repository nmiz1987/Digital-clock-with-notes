# Digital clock with notes

There is nothing like a new watch to feel better, so why not build a new one? I wanted to build an elegant and simple watch that I could turn on for my smartphone and iPad while I was using the computer.
I've added a field of notes so I can see the important things at a glance, the notes will be saved locally.
